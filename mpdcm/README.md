## Introduction

mpdcm is a toolbox for efficient integration of the dynamical system defined
by DCM (see citations) on GPU architectures. Besides the core code, several 
routines for statistical inference are defined as part of our toolbox, 
including a map estimator, a mle estimator, variational Bayes hierarchical 
inference, thermodynamic integration, and population MCMC. All this tools 
are documented below.

## Compilation

Currently only LINUX is supported for compilation. We have compiled in a few
different platforms successfully. Please refer to the doc/test.tx


## Initilization

Simply execute the file on the top folder startup()

## MAP estimator

## MLE estimator

## VM hierarchical inference

## Thermodynamic integration

## Population MCMC
